<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Miguel Chau, a passionate game developer with experience in <strong> Unity </strong> and a growing
  interest in <strong> Unreal Engine.</strong>
  I love bringing ideas to life, whether it's crafting immersive <strong>2D pixel-art adventures</strong> , developing engaging <strong>3D
  experiences</strong>,
  or experimenting with different mechanics to push gameplay to the next level.</p>

<p>Beyond game development, I'm also diving into <strong>full-stack development</strong>, expanding my skills in web technologies to
  build interactive applications.
  Always eager to learn, I enjoy tackling new challenges,
  optimizing systems, and refining gameplay mechanics to create smooth and fun player experiences.</p>

<p>This portfolio showcases some of my projects, from indie games to technical experiments. Feel free to explore,
  and <strong>if youâ€™re interested in collaboration or just want to chat about game dev, hit me up!</strong></p>
